## Install

Create a new bookmark in google chrome with the prefix: `javascript:` as the url then copy the contents 
of `fillGrades.js`. Name the bookmark whatever you want (i.e., Fill Grades). 

In synergy when entering grades click the book mark and then a textbox should showup at the bottom
of the page. 

The contents of the textbox expect a newline separated list of values to enter to the gradebook. The number
of values in the list MUST match the number of students on the current page.
